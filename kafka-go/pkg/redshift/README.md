# Redshift Library

Fork of https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift. Fork since it required changes specific to our use case and the code was not very generic to use it as a library. Also because the repo owners does not actively respond to issues and pull requests. I have opened issues in the [s3-to-redshift/issues](https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift/issues) for this. We will contribute back to s3-to-redshift to make it more generic and usable for all use cases if they are open to it.

It is kept in this repo as making changes becomes easier to quickly develop, later may be it will be taken out and keep it like an actual fork if contribution did not happen to s3-to-redshift.
