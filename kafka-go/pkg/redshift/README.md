# Redshift Library

Fork of [s3-to-redshift](https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift)

Fork because:

1. It lacks all schema migration features and only support ADD columns.
2. The repo owners does not actively respond to issues and pull requests. I have opened issues in the [s3-to-redshift/issues](https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift/issues) for this. We will contribute back to s3-to-redshift if they are open for it.

// TODO:
Also, It is kept in this repo as making changes becomes easier to quickly develop, vendoring slows the development speed. Later, when we hit prod and we entain stability we should take out the library and keep it as a fork if contribution to [s3-to-redshift](https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift) does not work out.
