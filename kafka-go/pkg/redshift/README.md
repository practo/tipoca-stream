# Redshift Library

Fork of https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift.

Fork because:

1. It lacks all schema migration features and only support ADD columns.
2. The repo owners does not actively respond to issues and pull requests. I have opened issues in the [s3-to-redshift/issues](https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift/issues) for this. We will contribute back to s3-to-redshift if they are open for it.

// TODO:
Also, It is kept in this repo as making changes becomes easier to quickly develop, later may be it will be taken out and kept like an actual fork if contribution did not happen to s3-to-redshift.
