# Redshift Library

Fork of https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift. Fork since it required changes specific to our use case. It is kept in this repo making changes becomes easier.

Later, when this becomes live in production and everything works. We will contribute back to s3-to-redshift to make it more generic and usable for all use cases.

Also open source this.
