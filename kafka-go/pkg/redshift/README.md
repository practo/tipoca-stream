# Redshift Library

Fork of [s3-to-redshift](https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift)

Fork because:

1. It lacks all schema migration features and only support ADD columns. This has most migration features in it.
2. The repo owners does not actively respond to issues and pull requests. I have opened issues in the [s3-to-redshift/issues](https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift/issues) for this. We will contribute back to s3-to-redshift if they are open for it.

// TODO:
Also, It is kept in this repo as making changes becomes easier to quickly develop, vendoring slows you down. Later it should be taken out and kept like an actual fork if contribution did not happen to [s3-to-redshift](https://github.com/Clever/s3-to-redshift).
